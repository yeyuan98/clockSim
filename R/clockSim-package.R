#' clockSim: Simulation of the Circadian Clock Gene Network.
#'
#' This package provides preconfigured circadian clock gene network simulation 
#' models based on the Odin simulation engine.
#' 
#' Circadian clock is a paradigm for studying negative-positive feedback 
#' mechanisms in Biology. Molecular clock, a cell-autonomous 
#' transcriptional-translational feedback, is one of the best known gene 
#' network oscillators.
#' 
#' Despite widespread interest on molecular clock research, numerical 
#' simulation of the clock remains elusive to many if not most wet-lab 
#' biologists, which hindered generation of novel hypotheses and efficient 
#' exploration of the clock parameter space.
#' 
#' This package aims to provide a low-friction workflow for molecular clock 
#' simulation, thereby unleashing the power of in silico exploration to more.

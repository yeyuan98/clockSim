Description: A user-friendly workflow for simulating circadian clock gene networks. 
  Despite decades of advances in modeling circadian clock dynamics, 
  the lack of accessible tools for reproducible simulation workflows 
  hinders the integration of computational modeling with experimental studies. 
  'clockSim' addresses this gap by providing models and helper functions 
  with step-by-step vignettes. This package opens up system-level exploration 
  of the circadian clock to wet-lab experimentalists, and future development 
  will include additional clock architectures and other gene circuit models. 
  Currently implemented models are based on 
  Leloup and Goldbeter (1998) <doi:10.1177/074873098128999934>.
